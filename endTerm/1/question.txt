Q1. Standard OS networking stacks manage protocol headers automatically. In this
task, you will bypass the stack to manually "forge" a packet with intentional errors
to observe how network layers respond to corruption. Create a C raw socket
program to: [20 marks]

a) Manually construct the Ethernet Header, IP Header, and UDP Header.

b) You must deliberately calculate an incorrect UDP checksum and inject it into
the header.

c) The payload must contain your Roll Number and the current system username
and time.

d) Setup a topology with two hosts (h1,h2) and a single switch. Execute your
script from h1 targeting h2.

e) Use Wireshark on h2 to capture the incoming frame.

Submission Requirement: Provide a screenshot of the Wireshark "Packet Details"
pane. The screenshot must clearly show the "UDP Checksum: [Incorrect]" warning
and your unique Roll Number in the Data payload.
